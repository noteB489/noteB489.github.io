After the configuration of this website through the Jekyll remote theme plugin.
There is a need for customization of this website so I go back to the first step.
This page has a piece of information for building a website using Jekyll template.

In order to organize the Jekyll customizable website(not the remote plugin), you should install the Ruby.
Visit the [RubyInstaller] website.
[RubyInstaller]: https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
Download and install RubyInstaller above version 2.4.
Last step of installation, do the 'ridk install'.
Run the terminal(cmd) and configure 'PATH' and install the Jekyll and the Bundler. 'gem install jekyll bundler'
